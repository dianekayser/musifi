MUSIFI - musical instrument finder

## Summary

tool to help parents to choose the right (best suitable) musical instrument for their kids


## Background

* kids (or their parents) often choose the wrong musical instrument for their kids, so the kids loose interest in music very quickly
* every year music schools notice a decreasing number of students registering for wind instrument lessons - on the other hand, piano classes and waiting lists for other solo instruments increase very fast 
* music associations and orchestras lament that there is a decreasing number of young sudents playing wind instruments and an augmentation of kids playing solo instruments, even when a wind instrument would be the better choice for many kids (financial aspects, faster learning progress, size of the fingers, strength, concentration,...). There is not much offspring of orchestra musicians.

Age

With age comes increased physical strength and height. Both of these should be considered when selecting an instrument for a child. While it is easier to learn music at a young age, some musical instruments are more suitable kids when they develop the necessary strength to hold the instrument in place and/or grow taller relative to the size of the instrument.

Physical strengh

Some musical instruments are bulky and heavy. A child will need some strength to hold the instruments to play as well as to transport these instruments. Core and back strength are important too for learners to maintain their proper posture.

Height 

Some instruments require a child to be of a certain size to be played. Many instruments come in various sizes, such that a child can start learning early. However, this means that parents have to invest in properly fitted instruments as the child grows.

Noise

While living in an apartment, or a house with a close neighborhood, the sound intensity of an instrument should be considered.

Space

While living in a small house or an apartment, a smaller instrument would be a better choice than an bulky instrument.

Oral features 

Beginner learners of brass and woodwind instruments will take some time to develop the necessary embouchure (mouth placement) for their respective instruments. If a child needs to undergo orthodontic treatment (eg. braces), it may be better to avoid instruments that involve blowing because practicing could inflict pain.

Size of hands

If a child happens to have larger-than-average hands with long fingers, he or she will have an easier time playing the piano, especially at higher levels, where playing chords spanning more than one octave is common. 

Personality

It’s also important to consider a child’s personality when choosing an instrument. A child will have different experiences learning and performing different instruments. Extraverted children who love to be the center of attention may be more suited to learning a wind or string instrument as players of these instruments are commonly part of musical groups. On the other hand, reserved and contemplative children may be more comfortable with a solo instrument, which is more commonly learned and performed alone or in small groups.

Common or less common instruments 

Instead of being just another learner of the piano, guitar, or violin, some children may prefer to be unique and recognised for having a very special, niche skill of their own. As such, they may rather learn a comparatively rare instrument.
This children will also be in high demand by ensembles. 

Interest

Perhaps most importantly, a child must at least be remotely interested in the instrument. While it’s normal for young children to gain and lose interest in things quickly, it’s essential that a child is enthusiastic in learning the instrument at the beginning. If a child can appreciate the sounds of the instrument, he or she will be more likely to enjoy learning the instrument. 

Financial aspects

Pianos tend to be the most expensive.
Wind instruments are a lot more affordable. However, parents may have to invest in larger sized and higher quality instruments for their child as he or she grows and progresses.
Pianos need to be tuned at least twice a year.
Stringed instruments need their strings replaced.
Woodwind instruments need their reeds changed, corks replaced, and yearly adjustments by a instrument technician.

## How is it used?

This tool could be used before a registration at a music school. It could be a smartphone appilication, the parents could use independently, or it could be a tool used by the music schools to advise the kids and their parents and support them in finding the right choice in picking a musical instrument.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data would be collected by a smartphone/tablet app or a website specially designed for this matter. Parents anwer questions about their kids (age, strength, interests,...).
For the adjustment of the application, music teachers of the specific music school would be asked to aswer a survey about when kids best start to play the different instruments, which height is required,... The parameters can vary depending on the music school, so it would be important that this input data could be changed and adapted for every musi school. 

## Challenges

The project would of course not solve the problem of lack of interest in playing wind instruments. But it could at least suggest the instrument that suits the kids best and a chance to explore music in a different way, such as they don't loose interest in music in general so quickly.
