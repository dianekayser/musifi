# Project Title

MUSIFI - musical instrument finder

## Summary

tool to help parents to chose the right (best suitable) musical instrument for their kids


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* kids (or their parents) often chose the wrong musical instrument for their kids, so the kids loose interest in music very quickly
* every year music schools notice a decreasing number of students register for wind instrument lessons - otherwise, piano classes and waiting lists for other soli instruments explode  
* music associations and orchestras lament that there is a deccreasing number of young sudents playing wind instruments and an augmentation of kids playing solo instruments, even when a wind instrument would be the better choice for many kids (financial aspects, faster learning progress, size of the fingers, strength, concentration,...)


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
